# Purpose
To experiment with different techniques for real-time fluid simulation and rendering in Rust/Bevy by making a beautiful realistic lake drawing toy.

Kanban board: https://github.com/users/wkwan/projects/2

Currently it's just a Bevy/Rust implementation of https://github.com/SebLague/Fluid-Sim

# To run demo:
```
cargo run --release
```

Press F1 to toggle simulation parameters.
