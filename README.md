# Purpose
To experiment with different techniques for real-time fluid simulation and rendering in Rust/WGSL/Bevy by making a beautiful realistic lake drawing toy.

Fluid simulation is currently done with a particle-based approach called Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Code is heavily based off of https://github.com/SebLague/Fluid-Sim

# To run demo:
